### Outline
By tracking the changes in immigration volume and point of origin, we hope to show how current events and changing political climates affect American immigration policy and population migration.  We will produce a number of visualizations showing immigration trends over time.  We will explore these changes, and attempt to tie them to specific events or legislation.

### Possible Visualizations (pending review)
* Heat map of immigration countries of origin (by decade, event, etc.)
* Volume of green cards or new permanent residents granted by year (looking for exceptional trends, especially in times of war)
* Volume of asylum seekers/political refugees compared to legal immigrants/permanent residents (by country, decade, etc.)
